Programming Language: Python

To execute the program, type this line into the command line: python3 Cipher.py <ciphername> <key> <enc/dec> <inputfile> <outputfile>

Execution example: pyhton3 Cipher.py ces 3 enc small.txt output.txt

Did not attempt extra credit

Anyhting special:
- I added another function to Ciperinterface that helped keep the result output clean.
- there cannot be any spaces in the key for example in row transposition, key needs to be "42135" instead of "4 2 1 3 5"
